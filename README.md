# Trial-at-a-game
Just a test or attempt rather, at creating a game.


That's right. As the above description states, I just want to test and poke my head through the doors of possibilities.
I don't have the javascript skills to carry me through those doors, but if we stick to what I know and what I can know, I can create many posibilities already.

Firstly, I have had many ideas... But, to create them, It would be a long and gruesome task... But, there is one thing I am good at!
And that is writing. Actually, I'm not that good but i'm good enough to write a story and why not make that into a website.
Even better, why not make that into an interactive website... An Interactive Story!!!
That's how the idea came to mind. The seed has been planted and i'm now watering it because it's possible...
A personal project that is both learning objective and interesting. It's also unique!
Who else is going to do something like this?
I expect everyone to do websites to be honest... It's what we've been learning and the easiest to achieve.
But mine will be playable.. A game!
Maybe someone else has thought of the same idea, but the same story? It's impossible... (Not joking, unless someone just copied me... C'mon bruh)
I shall achieve this will the learnings we've been provided and the knowledge I've had as an Author (Note: Hasn't published anything or written any plausible "book-sized" literatures...)
